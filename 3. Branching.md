# Branching

Branching is when you diverge from the main line of development so as  not to mess it up when working.

---
## Branching in a Nutshell
---

Git stores data as a series of snapshots. Each one of them has some info (author name, commit message etc) and pointer(s) to its parent(s) - commits that come immediately before it.

- Zero parents: Initial commit
- One parent: Normal commit
- Multiple parents: Commit that results from merging two or more branches

A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.

By default, `git init` creates a branch named __master__, but it's not something special.

When you create a new branch, you create a new pointer at the same commit you're currently on. Git knows this commit because it saves it in a special pointer called _HEAD_.

---
## Switching Branches
---

Switch to another branch:

`git checkout [branch-name]`

I checked online that you can also use:

`git switch [branch-name]`

(And you can also use `git restore file` instead of `git checkout -- file`)

When switching branches, files in the working directory change.

A branch in Git is in actuality a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to.

---
## Basic Branching and Merging
---

Create a branch and switch to it:

`git checkout -b [branch-name]`

This is shorthand for:

`git branch [branch-name]`

`git checkout [branch-name]`

Git won't let you switch branches, if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you're checking out.

Let's say, there is a bug in the production code which is in the _master_ branch. To fix it without messing with the production code, you create a new branch, named _hotfix_. When you fix the bug and everything runs smoothly, you should:

`git checkout master`

`git merge hotfix`

__Fast-forward__ happens when Git just moves the HEAD forward, because there isn't divergent work to merge together. This occurs when the commit you merge is directly upstream of the commit you're on.

After you have merged the branches, you should delete the _hotfix_ branch:

`git branch -d hotfix`

---
## Basic Merging
---

Check out the branch you want to merge into and the run `git merge`

If the commit on the branch you're on isn't a direct ancestor of the branch you're merging in, Git does a three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two. This creates a new commit, which is called _merge commit_, and it has multiple parents.

---
## Basic Merge Conflicts
---

A _conflict_ occurs when the same part of the same file have changed in the two branches you're merging.

Git add standard conflict-resolution markers, like:

`<<<<<<<`

`=======`

`>>>>>>>`

You have to manually resolve this conflicts to continue merging

__Tip:__ The first part (on top of `=======`) is the version in HEAD (i.e. the branch you have currently checked out)

If you resolve one conflict, the aforementioned marks will be removed. After taking care of all of them, you can _stage_ the file. Doing that, the Git assumes that this file is resolved.

If you want a __graphical tool__ to resolve conflicts:

`git mergetool`

---
## Branch Management
---

`git branch`

When there are no arguments, you simply get a listing of your current branches.

The `*` character show the branch

To see the last commit on each branch:

`git branch -v`

To see the branches you have merged into the brunch you are currently on:

`git branch --merged`

Accordingly, you can run:

`git branch --no-merged`

If a branched isn't merged in yet, you __cannot__ delete it with:

`git branch -d [branch-name]`

If you want to, anyway. You can force it using `-D` in lieu of `-d`.

--- 
## Branching Workflows
--- 

### Long-Running Branches
In the _master_ branch you've just the stable code. You have another branch called _develop_ or _next_ in which the code isn't necessarily stable. Also, it's used to pull in __topic branches__, which are short-lived branches.

The stable branches are further down the line in your commit history. The bleeding-edge branches are further up.

`master <--- develop <--- topic`

Some projects have an extra branch, usually named _pu (proposed updated)_, that has integrated branches that may be not ready to go neither into _master_ nor _develop_. You can have multiple branches that signify multiple stages of stability.

### Topic Branches
They are useful in projects of any size. They are __short-lived__ branches for a single particular feature or related work.

After merging them into your main branch, you delete them.

- They allow you to context-switch quick and completely
- It's easier to review changes

__Tip__: You can create two topic branches that attempt to resolve the same bug with different ways. You merge into your main branch just the one that you believe that does the optimal work.

---
## Remote Branches
---

They are references (pointers) to the state of branches in your remote repositories.

These branches don't move automatically, it must be a network communication.

They take the form `(remote)/(branch)`.

If you do some work locally and someone else pushes to the remote repository, then your histories move forward differently.

To synchronize your work, you should run:

`git fetch origin`

After that, the pointers of the branches, that have been altered by others, move to their new more up-to-date positions.

### Pushing

Local branches aren't automatically synchronized to the remotes. When you want to share them, you have to _push_ them. You can explicitly share some of them and not others, that you want to keep private.

To share a branch type:

`git push (remote) (branch)`

If you want the remote branch to have a different name, then you should type:

`git push (remote) (local-branch):(remote-branch)`

__Tip:__ If you don't want to type your credentials every time you push, you can type:

`git config --global credential.helper cache'

That keeps the credentials in the memory for a few minutes.

I think that if you want to never type your credentials again, you should type replace _cache_ with _store_.

You should remember that when you fetch from the server, you don't automatically have local, editable copies of the branches - you only have (remote)/(branch) pointers that you can't modify.

You have to merge this work to your current branch:

`git merge (remote)/(branch)`

Or if you want to create your own local branch:

`git checkout -b (branch) (remote)/(branch)

If you want the local branch to have the same name with the remote one, you could also type:

`git checkout --track (remote)/(branch)

### Tracking Branches
When you check out a local branch form a remote branch, it is created a _tracking branch_ (or _upstream branch_). These branches have a direct relationship with the remote ones.

This is why git automatically knows what to do when pushing or pulling. These commands don't need any arguments.

If you already have a local branch and want to set it on a remote branch you can use the _-u_ or the _--set-upstream_ option.

`git branch -u (remote)/(branch)`

__Note (Upstream shorthand)__: You can reference to the remote tracking branch with `@{u}` or `@{upstream}`. So, if you are on _master_ and you want the remote branch to be merged, you could type:

`git merge @{u}`

Instead of:

`git merge origin/master`

To see some information about your tracking branches:

`git branch -vv`

This shows how many commits the local branches are distances from the remote ones, since the last time you ran `git fetch --all`

### Pulling
`git pull` is equivalent to `git fetch; git merge;` in most cases.

Generally, it's better not to use `git pull`. The "magic" of this command can be confusing.

### Deleting Remote Branches
Let's that you don't need a remote branch anymore, because you have already merged it into your remote's master branch. You can delete it, if you run:

`git push origin --delete (branch)`

This removes the pointer from the server. The Git server keeps the data until a garbage collection runs. So if it was accidentally delete, it's often easy to recover.

---
## Rebasing
---

In Git there are two way to integrate changes from one branch to another:
1. merge
2. rebase

### The Basic Rebase

Let's say that you have two commits _C3_ and _C4_ that both of them are pointing to _C2_. If you perform a three-way __merge__ between the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the recent common ancestor of them (C2), you will create a new commit (C5) that will be pointing to _C3_ and _C4_.

With the __rebase__ command, you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in _C4_ and replay it on top of _C3_.

**Caution**: In the first example, when _merging_, you were checking out the _master_ branch (commit _C3_). In the second example, when rebasing, you were checking out the _devel_ branch (commit _C4_).

`git checkout devel`

`git rebase master`

When _rebasing_, you find the common ancestor of the two branches (C2). Next, you get the diff introduced by each commit and you save them in a temporary file. Then, you reset the branch you are checking out to the same commit as the branch you are __rebasing onto__. And finally, you apply each change in return. At this point, you go back to the _master_ branch and do a fast-forward merge. Now, both of the HEADs of the branches pointing to the commit _C4'_, and the last one is solely pointing to _C3_.

The end product of _merging_ and _rebasing_ is the same, but rebasing makes for a cleaner history - it look like a linear history, whilst the work was done in parallel. 

A common case of using the _rebase_ command is when you contribute to a remote branch that you don't maintain. You rebase your work onto _origin/master_ so the maintainer won't have to do any work, just a _fast-forward_ of a _clean apply_.

```
"Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in the order they were introduced, whereas merging take the endpoint and merges them."
