# Git Basics
---
When git says that a file is **untracked**, it means that it doesn't exist in any previous snapshot (commit).

| Basic git command | Functionality |
|---|---|
| `git reset HEAD <file>` | unstage |
| `git add/rm <file>` | update what will be committed|
| `git checkout --<file>` | discard changes |

`git status -s` or `--short` provides a simplified output

`git diff` is more precise than `git status`

| `git diff` | Functionality |
|:---|:---|
| no args | changed but not staged yet |
| `--staged` | what have already been staged and <br> will go into the next commit |
| `--cached` | what have been staged so far <br> (not only in the last commit)

## Ignoring Files

Inside the .gitignore file:
* Blank lines or lines starting with `#` are ignored
* Patterns apply globally
* Directories are specified with `/`
* Everything starting with `!` is negated (e.g. you want to exclude all `.tex` files but to include `main.tex`, you should write `!main.tex`)
* `*` matches zero or more characters
* `?` matches  exactly one character
* `.[oae]` means `.o`, `.a` and `.e`
* `**` matches nested directories (e.g. `a/**/z` can be interpreted as `a/b/z`, `a/b/c/z` etc)

## Skip the staging area

`git commit -a -m <commit_message>`
**Automatically** stages every file that is **already tracked**

## Removing Files

The `git rm` command (i) removes a file from the **staging** area and also (ii) removes a file from your **working directory** (it deletes the file from the working tree) so as not to be seen as an **untracked** file.

If the file has been modified and already added to the index, the removal must be **forced**.

If you want to remove a file from the staging area (e.g. because you added it accidentally) **BUT** you don't want to delete the file (remove it from the working tree), you should use the `--cached` option. For example:
`git rm --cached README.md`

Pattern can be used when removing files. It's is interesting that in the example given by the book, the **escape character `\`** is used. Because, git uses its own filename expansion on top of shell's filename expansion. The following example removes all files that end with `.log` inside the log folder:
`git rm log/\*.log`

## Moving Files

There are two ways to rename a file so as git can figure it out:
`git mv README.md README`
Is equivalent to:
```
mv README.md README
git rm README.md
git add README
```

## Viewing the Commit History

| Options | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -p | Show the patch introduced in each commit |
| --stat | Show statistics for files modified in each commit |
| --short-stat | Display only the changed/insertions/deletions line from the --stat command |
| --name-only | Show the list of files modified after the commit information |
| --name-status | Show the list of files affected with added/modified/deleted information as well |
| --abbrev-commit | Show only the first few characters of the SHA-1 checksum instead of all 40 |
| --relative-date | Display the date in a relative format, instead of using the full date format |
| --graph | Display an ASCII graph of the branch and merge history beside the log output |
| --pretty | Show commits in an alternate format. Options include oneline, short, full, fuller, and format (where you specify your own format) |

Useful options for `git log --pretyt=format`
| Options | Description output |
| --- | --- |
| %H | Commit hash 
| %T | Tree hash |
| %P | Parent hash |
| %ae | Author name |
| %ad | Author date |
| %ar | Author date, relative |
| %cn | Committer name |
| %ce | Committer e-mail |
| %cd | Committer date |
| %cr | Committer date, relative |
| %s | Subject |

### Limiting log output
|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|-(n)|Show the last n commits|
|--sicnce, --after|Limit commits to those made after the specified date|
|--until, --before|Limit commits to those made before the specified date|
|--author|Only show commits where the author entry matches the specified string|
|--committer|Only show commits where the committer entry matches the specified string|
|--grep|Only show commits with a commit message containing the spceified string|
|--S|Only show commits adding or removing code matching the string|

* If the first 3 options are in lowercase, then it is the abbreviated version
* author: person that originally wrote the file
* committer: person last applied the work

## Undoing Things

__Caution:__ This is one of the few areas in Git that you could actually loose some work. 

When you commit too early, forget to add some files, or mess up the commit message, you can use:

`git commit --amend`

## Unstaging a Staged File

`git reset HEAD <file>`

By default, git reset is not dangerous, it only touches the staging area; the file remains modified.

__Caution:__  `--hard` option is dangerous, because you could loose some progress.

## Unmodifying a Modified File

`git checkout -- <file>`

It is as dangerous as  `git reset --hard <file>`
Any changes made to that file are gone. You just copied another file over it. Don't ever use this command unless you are absolutely sure that you don't want this file.

If you want to keep the changes you've made to a file but still need to get it out of the way, you could use _stashing_ and _branching_.

The only thing that really gets lost in git is the one that never commited.

## Working with remotes

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.

## Showing Your Remotes

__origin__ is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from.

`git remote -v`

The `-v`  option show the URL too.

## Adding Remote Repositories

`git remote add <shortname> <URL>`

Now we can use the  `<shortname>` in the command line in lieu of the whole `<URL>`.

Let's say that you specified the short name as _chsp_ (from Christoforos Spartalis).

If you `git fetch chsp`, you can access Christoforos' master branch locally. You can merge it into one of your branches or checkout to it, if you want to inspect it.

## Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes

To get data from your remote you can run:
`git fetch [remote-name]`

This commands pulls down all the data from the remote project that you don't have yet. After this, you can access all the branches from the remote (merge or just inspect).

If you __clone__ a repository, then the remote is under the name _origin_.  So `git fetch origin` fetches any new work since you cloned (or last fetched from).

The _fetch_ command pulls the data to your local repository, but doesn't automatically merge it or modify what you're currently working on. This is something you have to do manually when you're ready.

If you want the aforementioned functionality, you should use the _pull_ command instead. `git clone` automatically sets up your local master branch to track the remote master branch. `git pull` fetches data from where you originally cloned from and tries to merge it into the code you're currently working.

## Pushing to Your Remotes

`git push [remote-name] [branch-name]`

If you want to push your master branch to your origin server:

`git push origin master`

Requirements for this to work:
1. You have write access to that server
2. Nobody else has pushed in the meantime

If the second one is valid, then you have to pull down their work first and incorporate it into your before you'll be allowed to push.

## Inspecting a Remote

To see more information about a particular remote:

`git remote show [remote-name]`

The output of this command tells you _push_ or _pull_ which are the local and remote branches that will participate automatically in the data transaction.

Specifically, this command shows you:
1. Which branch is automatically pushed to when you run git push while on certain branches
2. Which remote branches on the server you don't have yet
3. Which remote branches you have, that have been removed from the server
4. Multiple branches that you are automatically merged when you run git pull

## Removing and Renaming remotes

To rename a reference you can run:

`git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>`

For example:

`git remote rename ChristoforosSpartalis chsp`

This changes the remote names too; what used to be referrenced at _chsp/master_ is now at _ChristoforosSpartalis/master_.

If you want to remove a remote for some reason:

`git remote rm chsp`

## Tagging

Tag specific points in history as being important. Often, it is used to maark releases (v1.0 etc).

## Listing Your Tags

`git tag`

When you want to list tag with a particular pattern:

`git tag -l 'v1.8.5*'`

Git uses 2 main types of tags:
1. Lightweight
2. Annotated (recommended)

A _lightweight_ tag is very much like a branch that doesn't change; it's just a pointer to a specific commit.

An _annotated_ tag is a full object in Git database. It's checksummed, contains the tagger name, e-mail, and date. It has a tagging message and can be verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)

## Annotated Tags

`git tag -a v1.4 -m 'ny version 1.4'`

`git show v1.4`

## Lightweight Tags

To create a lightweight tag, don't supply the -a, -s, or -m option:
`git tag v1.4-lw`
When running  `git show v1.4-lw`, you don't see the extra tag information, just the commit.

## Tagging Later 

You can, also, tag commits after you've moved past them.
You've just have to specify the commit checksum (or part of it)

`git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02`

## Sharing Tags

By default, tags are stored only locally. If you want to push tags to a shared server, you can run:

`git push origin [target-name]`

`git push origin v1.5`

If you want to push up many tags at once:

`git push origin --tags`

This transfers all tags that are not already in the remote server.

## Git Aliases

Some frequently used aliases to be quicker (I don't like them : / ):

`git config --global alias.co checkout`

`git config --global alias.br bracnh`

`git config --global alias.ci commit`

`git config --global alias.st status`

You can also create commands that you think should exist:

`git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'`

`git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'`

And if you want to run an external command, rather than a Git subcommand, add '!' at the beginning:

`git config --global alias.visual "!gitk"`
